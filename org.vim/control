Description: Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.
  This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
  All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type with ten fingers can work very fast.
  Additionally, function keys can be mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.
